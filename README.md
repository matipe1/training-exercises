# training-exercises
It's a repository where I will upload the most interesting exercises that helped me to understand some things about coding.
* Some codes will have a brief explanation about how I made them or how I applied the logical resolution
* Most of the codes won't have the excessive use of Python methods, that is, I will try to apply my own functions

Firstly, I'm going to solve some Python exercises and when I think I need to advance there will be time to pass into another
topic from my relevance just as SQL or some libraries of Python.
