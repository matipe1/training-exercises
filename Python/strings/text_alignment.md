# Text Alignment

This is an exercise from HackerRank created in order to know how to align strings in a line text.

In Python, a text can be aligned in relation to something,I mean any string like '-'.
As an example if you have a string'name' you could align the text with a determined
width and elements with the code:

    'name'.center(10, '-')

### There are 3 basic methods:

* .ljust(width)
* .rjust(width)
* .center(width)
