# Swap Case

This is an exercise where I'm working with strings and Algorithms.

---

Well, this exercise wasn't so heavy, because I worked a lot with this type of structures
at the University. In fact, I have a course called 'Data Structures and Algorithms'.
By the way it is not an easy exercise to do, but you need to have worked with this before.

## The exercise consist in...
To start with, you have to pass a string which it's returned with the cases swapped, i.e.
if a character case is lower, will be returned as upper case and vice versa.
    
    Input -> 'MyNaMeIsDiego'

    Output -> 'mYnAmEiSdIEGO'


### Conclusion
It's always good to know very well how to work with strings and to know how to solve different
types of algorithms related to text's iteration.
