# Find the Porcentage

This is an exercise where I'm working as my first time with dictionaries.

---

After doing this exercise I realize I don't know the necessary to work with dictionaries,
but it was a great exercise to practice and to know what I need to reinforce. To be the 
first time I think I did quite well (but the code could be better).

## The exercise consist in...
At first, the amount of students will be passed. In each of the next lines should be passed
one student followed by the scores he or she did, and in the next line (after the students)
must be passed the name of the student you want to know the average of the scores.
Example of the input():
    
    3  # Students' amount

    Krishna 67 68 69  # Student' names and scores
    Arjun 70 98 63
    Malika 52 56 60

    Query Name: Malika  # Student's query name


The system will calculate automatically the average of the query student.

## Complications I had
* One of the problems I faced was that I didn't know very well how to access to the information
of the dictionaries
* Another one is that I don't understand very well how map() function works
* The last complication I had was with the return with 2 float decimals. This is because I wrote
round(output, 2) but I need to use the format of the file that has a similar use with dates, I mean
when you need to use hours, minutes, seconds with 00:00:00 format

### Conclusion
it has been worth working with dictionaries to know what I am going to face and what I have to 
focus on when I am reading the documentation.
